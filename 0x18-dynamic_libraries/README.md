# Dynamic libraries

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX-Software Engineering School**. It aims to learn about dynamic and shared libraries in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `libholberton.s` | Dynamic library that contains many functions |
| `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh` | Shell script that creates a dynamic library |
| `100-operations.so` | Dynamic library that contains mathematical functions |
| `101-make_me_win.sh` | Shell script that injects a C program in order to hack `gm` executable file |
